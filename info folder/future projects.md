if you are curious about what jHAX7, kristheamazing2 and flynn are planning on doing in the future here is a list of all our upcoming projects with info,
info meaning if a project says "BETA" it means we have already started working on it but we are still in the early stages of coding and won't be done for a 
fewer weeks or months, if a project says "ALPHA" it means we have finished the coding but aren't sure if it works or is compatible with all devices and if a
project says "no coding started" it means we have plans to make that hack but haven't started the coding yet. anyway heres the list

more upgraded existing hacks (alpha)
hacks that used to work but got taken down (beta)
the secret powerful hack mentioned by kristheamazing2 (beta)
infinity tokens (beta) (more info in our infinity tokens page)
hacks for non blooket games like kahoot or readtheory (no coding started)
more scratch games (info, if you didn't know me and kristheamazing2 have made our own games on game creating websites before like our most popular game mapcar)
